After graduating from university, I started working in the world of .NET, specifically with Web technology using Asp.NET.

**ASP.NET**

I participated in industrial projects, in these projects, I used the .NET 4.5 Framework and tools to complement Technologies Used:

    • ASP.NET 4.5 + Framework
    • C# and VB
    • HTML
    • CSS
    • JavaScript
    • Bootstrap

The types of projects I started with in .NET were:
    
    • Web Forms
    • Asp MVC 4

In the following project, I show how I worked with .NET 5 Core Razor Pages. This example is also a monolithic application.

    • Department module administration https://github.com/AldoRomeroJimenez/AspNetCoreRazorPages

# Monolithic Applications
As an example of monolithic applications, I present a technical test to be able to enter a company, which is made in Asp.NET MVC. The following link will redirect to a certain test

    • Technical Test https://github.com/AldoRomeroJimenez/TestCoppel/tree/master
    • Department module administration https://github.com


# Microservices
In the microservices projects I have worked on, I created APIs for independent modules. I have a contract system prototype that is designed as an app where I separate the backend from the frontend. Examples of these projects are:

    • Account Authorization/Authentication - ASP.NET 6 (https://github.com/AldoRomeroJimenez/fms.contratos.account)
    • Events - node.js (https://github.com/AldoRomeroJimenez/node-express-apirest-mssql)
    • Providers - Java Spring Boot (https://github.com/AldoRomeroJimenez/proveedorAPI)

These microservices examples are in different technologies and are a demonstration of their use and capacity in my work history.

# Frontend
In FrontEnd applications, I have worked with Angular 11+. The tools used in the projects are:

    • Modules
    
    • Components
    
    • Material
    
    • Routes and LazyLoad

# Mobile (Android)
Currently, I am working on projects where I have developed mobile apps with Android using:

    • Java 17
    • Kotlin

At the moment, I am only using Android Studio for design. I also use the Material library for the views.
